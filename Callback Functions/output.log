## Solution

The solution to this problem is simple. All it involves is adding two numbers together.

### Explanation

1. First we declare a function called `getSum`.
2. The function has two parameters `a` and `b` which represent the two numbers we want to add.
3. Inside the function, we declare a variable `sum` and assign it the value of `a` plus `b`.
4. We then return the value of `sum` to the program.
5. The `getSum` function can then be called with any two numbers as arguments and it will return the sum of those two numbers.

### Example

1. Let's assume we want to add 2 and 3 together.
2. The `getSum` function is[0m
