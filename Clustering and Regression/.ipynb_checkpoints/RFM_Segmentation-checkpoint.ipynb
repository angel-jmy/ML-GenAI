    "- Feature importance analysis revealed that the number of purchases, days from the most recent purchase (DaySince), and duration of engagement with the platform (Duration) were the most influential predictors of customer lifetime value. Some geographic features (country dummies) also played a crucial role, suggesting regional differences in customer behavior. These insights can help prioritize active, frequent customers and tailor strategies based on location."
