 Yes.
Follow up: Which country uses the rose as its national flower?
Intermediate answer: Revered in poetry, film, theatre and music, it's quite understandable why the rose is the national flower of the United States, the United Kingdom and the Maldives.
Follow up: What is the capital of the United States?
Intermediate answer: Washington, D.C.
So the final answer is: Washington, D.C.
