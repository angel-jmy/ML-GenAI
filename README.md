# ML-GenAI Training Projects

This repository contains hands-on projects completed as part of my AI/ML upskilling, focusing on practical applications of generative AI and foundational machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop end-to-end workflows that demonstrate the use of current tools and frameworks for data-driven analysis, prompt engineering, and LLM-based applications.

## Key Components

### LangGraph Workflows
- Built structured conversational flows using `LangGraph`, leveraging OpenAIâ€™s function calling and routing with `TypedDict` and `llm.with_structured_output()`.
- Developed branching logic for use cases like AI-powered floral recommendation systems.

### Data Analysis & Modeling
- Implemented clustering and regression workflows using scikit-learn to analyze synthetic datasets.
- Visualized model performance and feature insights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

### LLM Experimentation
- Explored prompt templating, output parsing, and LLM response customization.
- Applied `LangChain` and `OpenAI API` for agent-based workflows.

## Tools Used
- Python, LangGraph, LangChain, OpenAI API
- scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
